3. **Random Search Implementation:**  
   Perform Random Search to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space, especially for large datasets or complex models.

4. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Evaluate the performance of the tuned model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizations.
